When discusssing robots and their place in our world, one should address their incredible ability to perform a repetitive task with perfection every time. Robots are known for this, so why should we discuss it? The reality of the situation is that it puts workers out of a job. This is not something new, jobs have been replaced by machines throughout recorded history [reference] chapter 1. 

So if jobs have been replaced for millenia and we are still able to find jobs why should we discuss this topic? Robotics is an exploding field; much like industrial machines helped pave the way during the Industrial Revolution, we are quickly approaching a "Robot Revolution".

We are developing robots to perform every-day tasks for us because we enjoy automating mundane, boring tasks. Some tasks are dangerous, so we employ robots to do those tasks for us. We can make a lot of money from having robots perform some tasks more efficiently than humans. These robots have come gradually over many, many years and as a result most people are familiar with them and do not feel threatened by them, and why should they?

In 2013 Oxford published `The Future of Employment`_ which stated an estimated 47% of jobs in the United States are at risk. Some considered this report alarmist or scaremongering but numerous studies have been taken since and they all display varying degrees of the same prediction.

Great minds of the world say robots will take our jobs, so what's their to debate now? *Is it ethical to program or build a robot that is going to take someone's job?* 

Transportation jobs in the United States make up approximately 9% of our workforce according to the
`Bureau of Transportation Statistics`_

With automated vehicles we are poised to replace the majority of this workforce with robotic workers. Is it ethical to replace these workers? Is it ethical to *not* replace these workers?

In 2010 there was an estimated 5,419,000 `vehicle crashes`_, of which there were 33,000 deaths and 2,239,000 injuries. `It is estimated`_ that taking steering wheels out of human hands will save 300,000 lives per decade. People will continue to die to vehicular accidents so long as humans are behind the wheel. Not all accidents can be avoided and unfortunately some lives will still be lost with automated vehicles driving.

What about factory or fast food workers? Is it ethical to replace them? Is it ethical to *not* replace them? A machine can produce the same perfect part every time without getting sick, cutting corners, or having to get spun-up on the task before they generate at peak efficiency. How many times has your order been wrong at a restaurant? A robot can make the perfect burger every time and it can come to you without looking like it has been sat on. 

So if there are huge benefits to having robots perform easily repeatable tasks what do we do with the millions that will be unemployed? That is beyond the scope of robotics, but it is an inevitable problem that robots will cause.
